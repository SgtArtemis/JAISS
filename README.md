# JAISS : Just Another Intelligent Speaking System

This project is inspired by JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) program in [IRONMAN](http://bit.ly/sJ4lCc) movie.
Though currently I don't intend to do any interfacing with hardware (as JARVIS does :) and is 
definitely possible to achieve in Python like using Arduino boards, etc), but then you never
know what a system can evolve into.

Dependency:
* [Windows OS (for MS Speech API)]
* [pyspeech Project]
* [python-weather-api Project]

The current codebase is only a first cut, very initial (kind of POC level) put together code.

Also note that I am a noob in Python (just picked up couple of weeks back) and will be refining/refactoring the code
as and when I become more convergent with this language and features.

####To launch the program, launch first.py file which is the entry point of the program. [I know the filename sucks. I told you previously that its not anywhere ready for reuse :)]

### The project is heavily dependent of the below python modules/libs:

* [Python Speech Reco and TTS Project](http://code.google.com/p/pyspeech/)

* [Python Wather API Project](http://code.google.com/p/python-weather-api/)

Feel free to fork or peek into the code but note that the code is yet far from being a good program :)
